# Identify the Counterfeit Drugs in the Indain Drug Supply Chain using Bloackchain  
* In this Project, pharmaceutical manufacturers's can insert all the medicine data into the blockchain network. All the data is encrypted and stored on blockchain network.
* When data is inserted into network, this system will generate QR code and this QR code is printed on medicine packets.
* Now, when the customer will buy the medicines from the shop their task is to simply scan the QR code present on medicine packets and check the information present on server is same or not. If the data is matched then the medicine provided by the shop is authentic, else it's not authentic.
* The customer can also see all the travel history of medicine. So that they can identify whether the medicines came from valid source or not.
